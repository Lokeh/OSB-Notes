# A Developer's-Eye View of API Client Libraries

You don't want to keep handling HTTP/authentication

Maybe the API wasn't designed for you

Maybe the API wasn't designed well

## What makes a *good* client library

- Easy to understand
- Easy to get started
- Easy to use
- Easy to **DEBUG**
- Easy to improve

**NUMBER ONE THING: Findable and accurate documentation**

Questions docs should answer:
- What does it do
- What problem is it aimed at
- What isn't it good for
- Which version of the API does this client library handle

Take advantage of existing skills, platforms, tools, and packaging systems

Include HTTP, authentication, appropriate helper functions

Good API design:
- Self-explanatory, unambiguous naming
- Set good and courteous defaults
- Write tests
- Mark the corner cases

License it, and use an appropriate one.
Set accurate expectations.

Tools should make it possible to work more effectively and be designed with empathy
