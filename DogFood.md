# Dog Food is for Dogs

UX in open source projects.

Stanford UX process:
1. Empathize
2. Define
3. Ideate
4. Prototype
5. Test

Most creatives (incl. devs) start with ideate, then think about empathizing and defining after.

IBM study: Every $ spent on UX, yields $10. 

Empathy starts when you can tell someone else's story. Start by listening to them.

## How do empathy??

Get wide range of perspectives (other than your peers).

User studies. Ethnography. 30 min in-person interviews, diary studies, participatory journey mapping.

Then, design workshop.

### Observation vs. Interpretation

Keep ourselves honest.
